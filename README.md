# AWS base VPC Deployment

This code deploys the below VPC structure within the diagram, upon the AWS Cloud. For testing purposes, the VPC base foundation (1) has the main components to put your environment in operational state. If you want to explore aditional features like AWS Fargate, AWS Load Balancer, Amazon S3 or even RDS database AWS Aurora, pick-up the associated .yaml and go ahead.

## Installation

Since all the code is based on .yaml, you can deploy it directly on AWS CloudFormation and consider each file as an additional stack-set.

## Usage

You can 1) clone this repo or 2) download the individual files (respecting the directory structure). Up to you which options better fits your requirement ;-).
